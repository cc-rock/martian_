Martian Robots
==============

Improvements / next steps:

- Write a unit test for InputParser, checking that the example input parses correctly, 
and that empty lines and extra tabs/spaces do not affect the result
- Write more test cases in the RobotsProcessor unit test
- the InputParser implementation could possibly be rewritten in a more elegant way, using less state variables,
but it was late so I left it as a point of improvement.
